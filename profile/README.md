## Software
As RPS is a rapidly growing organization, new roles are created for continuous improvement for our clients and employees. With this, a software team is a new endeavor we're tackling to make the most our data and to automate as many processes as possible. This organization will provide as a portfolio and working environment for all employees contributing to these projects.

A current student pursuing Mechanical Engineering at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. I have been with the company since 2017 doing whatever I can to help. I have experience operating and setting up a majority of the CNC lathes that we have in house, but specialize in creating programs for the machines. Dabbling in automating some of the more mundane, repetative tasks that I and my coworkers are burdened with.
